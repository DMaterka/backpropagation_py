#  Backpropagation in python

This project is mainly for educational purpose. It will implement neural network backpropagation alghoritm. 
There will be provided examples of use with the data which have been checked manually. 

Currently there are are a couple of examples of backpropagation in action. 

## Example1

Simple backpropagation network problem of grouping of xor outputs with non-linear separation function. 

This demonstrates the weighed neurons in action. There is a sigmoid function used and the inputs are only 1,1

```
python3 example1.py
```
